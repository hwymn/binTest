# How do you create a Linux command?

1. Write script in VSCode or any other text editor
2. Save file as Bash file (.sh)
3. Formt. Use the "mv" command to change the name (remove the .sh). Can still use .sh, just more practical without it.
4. *Optional: Make sure the Bash file is in the bin folder (make sure there is a bin folder)
    Doesnt have to be "bin". Just following the Linux naming convention
5. Use "chmod" to modify permissions followed by "+x" to specify executable permissions
6. Add "PATH="$PATH:HOME/bin" to the .bashrc path file (.zshrc, etc.)
    (All caps means main/absolute path in Linux) ~/bin=/home/bin
    So we can use the command without the directory path. Essentially tells Linux to use a pre-existing path to access something


Custom Scripts Process

1. Create a Bash Script
    a. Create/Write the script (DOES NOT NEED ".sh". It is only for organizational purposes. The first line "shabang" is where the file type is defined)
    b. Format the script file
        i. Rename the file with "mv" to remove the ".sh" from the name
        ii. Change the file permissions. e.g. "chmod +x [name of file]". +x makes it execuatable.

2. Create a binn folder to store the custom scripts.
    a. Create a bin at the home-directory e.g. "~/home/username/bin".
    b. Move the created script-file into the bin folder.
    c. Configure the .bashrc of .zshrc (depends on your terminal configuration) to add the path we
        want the OS to follow and find the script at

3. Move the created script-file into the bin folder.
